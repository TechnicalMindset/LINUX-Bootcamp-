Assignment: Navigating and Managing Files in Linux 🌟
This assignment covers essential Linux commands for navigating the filesystem and managing files. Each concept builds upon the basics, helping you gain confidence in working with Linux directories and files.

🔍 Navigating Linux and Windows Filesystems
Exploring the Filesystem with cd
Today’s focus is on learning how to navigate the filesystem with the cd command. Practicing cd commands lets you move between directories, even if they’re on your Windows system, accessible from Ubuntu.
Example:
To navigate to a specific folder on your Windows drive:

bash
Kopiera kod
cd /mnt/c/Users/phili/Downloads/Farm
Here, /mnt is the mount point where Linux connects to the Windows filesystem, allowing easy access to Windows files and folders.

Tip: If your files are stored in different folders, such as Downloads and OneDrive, use the correct path to reach each location:

bash
Kopiera kod
cd /mnt/c/Users/phili/OneDrive/Farm
🗂️ Moving Up in Directories with cd
Going Up a Level
Learn to move up a directory level with cd ..:
bash
Kopiera kod
cd ..
Jumping Multiple Levels
To move two levels up and directly enter another directory, use:
bash
Kopiera kod
cd ../../another_directory
📂 Creating New Directories and Files
Creating Folders with mkdir
Use mkdir to create new directories.

Example:
bash
Kopiera kod
mkdir NewFolder
Making Multiple Folders at Once with mkdir -p
Create a full directory structure in one step:

bash
Kopiera kod
mkdir -p MainFolder/SubFolder
This command creates both MainFolder and SubFolder at once if they don’t already exist.

📄 Creating and Viewing Files: touch vs. echo
Creating Empty Files with touch
touch creates an empty file without any content.

Example:
bash
Kopiera kod
touch myfile.txt
Writing Content to Files with echo
Use echo to create a file and immediately add content:

Example:
bash
Kopiera kod
echo "This is a new file" > newfile.txt
🐱 Displaying File Content with cat
Viewing Files with cat
Use cat to display the content of a file directly in the terminal:
Example:
To view the content of myfile.txt:
bash
Kopiera kod
cat myfile.txt
This command lets you quickly check file content without needing to open a text editor.
🧠 Questions & Answers to Reinforce Learning
❓ What is /mnt in Linux, and why is it useful when navigating the Windows filesystem?

Answer: /mnt is the directory where Linux mounts other filesystems, like Windows drives, allowing you to access Windows files from the Linux terminal.
❓ What’s the difference between mkdir and mkdir -p?

Answer: mkdir creates a single folder. If it exists, it will return an error. mkdir -p allows you to create multiple folders and subfolders in one command.
❓ When should you use touch instead of echo?

Answer: Use touch when you want to create an empty file without content. Use echo to create a file and add content simultaneously.
❓ What does the cat command do, and when is it helpful?

Answer: cat displays the content of a file in the terminal, which is useful for quickly reviewing file content without opening an editor.
📚 Practice Exercises
Create a Folder Structure:
Navigate to /mnt/c/Users/phili/OneDrive and create a folder called Projects with a subfolder named 2024 in one command:

bash
Kopiera kod
mkdir -p Projects/2024
Create and Write to a File:
Inside Projects/2024, create a file called plan.txt and add the text "My plan for 2024":

bash
Kopiera kod
echo "My plan for 2024" > Projects/2024/plan.txt
Display File Content with cat:
View the content of plan.txt:

bash
Kopiera kod
cat Projects/2024/plan.txt
Create a File with Spaces in the Name:
Create a file named "my new document.txt" with proper syntax:

bash
Kopiera kod
touch "my new document.txt"
