ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Guide ðŸš¨

1. Email Notifications Not Sent
ðŸ›  Problem: The first email test failed due to an unconfigured mailutils.
ðŸ’¡ Solution: Configure postfix and update email settings to ensure messages are sent from the server.

2. Slow Backup for Large Files
ðŸ›  Problem: Backups took a long time when large files were included.
ðŸ’¡ Solution: Exclude temporary and log files that aren't needed to optimize backup time.

3. Errors Running Cron Job
ðŸ›  Problem: The cron job failed due to issues with environment variables.
ðŸ’¡ Solution: Add the full paths for each tool (e.g., /bin/tar) in the script to ensure cron can locate the commands.

4. Unable to Find Correct Script File
ðŸ›  Problem: The found script file was empty and located in /home/user/backups instead of the needed version in /root/technical_mindset/backup.sh.
ðŸ’¡ Solution: Move the directory from /home/user/backups to /root/technical_mindset/backups to access the correct script.

5. Issue with Accessing System Files on Windows 11 from WSL (Ubuntu)
ðŸ›  Problem: fdisk was unavailable in Ubuntu under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), blocking disk access attempts.
ðŸ’¡ Solution:
Step 1: Try sudo fdisk -l to list partitions (initial error: fdisk not found).
Step 2: Attempted installation of fdisk by installing util-linux:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install util-linux

ðŸš¨ However, the error persisted.

Step 3: Verify util-linux installation using:

dpkg -l | grep util-linux

Alternative Solution: Use lsblk instead:

sudo lsblk

Final Step: Directly access Windows files in WSL by navigating to /mnt/c, where Windows disks are automatically mounted.
